Dear Sojourner,

Imagine a food coop, but for technology...

Northbridge Technology Alliance is entirely devoted to advancing progress toward a sustainable and equitable society.

To help us get there, here is a membership invitation, available exclusively to the social justice community!

Might your mission-focused team or committee make use of better remote collaboration tools?

Our members have told us that web-based meetings and webinars are a useful collaboration tool for their activist work. Unfortunately, like so many other cutting edge technologies, grass roots and nonprofits find themselves going without, for cost and other reasons.

We have a solution, using our member-owned, cooperative approach to technology development.

Our membership program, starting at $120 annually, equips and trains Northbridge members with a state-of-the-art virtual web meeting room. This enables them to do long-distance collaboration, such as remote trainings, Board meetings, volunteer meetings, and small-scale webinars, without leaving home or office.

Not only that, but our members regularly work with our technology volunteers, developing new tools to support their socially progressive missions.

Best regards,

P.S. Many large corporations are realizing the advantages that virtual collaboration can provide. We are determined that you have the same opportunities for advancing your social justice mission.
